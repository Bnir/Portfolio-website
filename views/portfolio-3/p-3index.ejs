        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2><br>
        <h3>Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole
        of coding and web development. <br> <br>Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for an advertising 
        agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge corporation. <br><br>
        My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement. <br><br> I most enjoy building 
        software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are also built well under the hood. 
        <br> In my free time, I've also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API. <br><br>  
        When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around
