                <p class="starter">Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled
                    head first into
                    the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
                    building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge
                    corporation.</p>
                <p>My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement. I
                    most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look
                    good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an online video
                    course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.</p>
                <p>When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two
                    cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds.</p>
